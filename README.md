# Regression-in-R-Course-Assignment
Course Assignment using linear and generalized linear regression (groupwork)

This assignment is the practical assignment given in the course Regression. 
The assignment consists of an exploratory part, and then either a problem A or a problem B. 
It is up to you if you want to do problem A or B. If time permits, you can consider both, but you should focus on one of the problems. 
The solution is to be made in groups of 2-4 persons, and must be in the form of an html report including R code, tables and figures, which is uploaded to Absalon.
